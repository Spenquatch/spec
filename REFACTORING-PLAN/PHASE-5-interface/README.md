# PHASE-5: User Interface

## Overview

Creates the final user interface layer with Rich terminal UI and comprehensive CLI commands. This phase completes the refactoring by building a clean presentation layer that uses all the core services, while integrating enhanced error handling and user experience improvements.

## Prerequisites

- **PHASE-1 complete**: Exception hierarchy, logging, configuration, and Rich terminal styling
- **PHASE-2 complete**: File system operations
- **PHASE-3 complete**: Template system
- **PHASE-4 complete**: Git operations and core business logic services
- **Required modules**: All previous phase modules available

## Slice Execution Order

Execute slices in the following order due to dependencies:

1. **slice-12a-console-theme.md** - First (provides console and theme foundation)
2. **slice-12b-progress-components.md** - Second (provides progress tracking components)
3. **slice-12c-formatter-error-views.md** - Third (provides data formatting and error display)
4. **slice-13a-core-cli-scaffold.md** - Fourth (CLI foundation with shared options and core commands)
5. **slice-13b-generate-suite.md** - Fifth (generation commands that delegate to template engine)
6. **slice-13c-diff-history-suite.md** - Sixth (diff and history commands on top of Git adapter)

## Shared Concepts

- **Rich Terminal UI**: Comprehensive styling, progress bars, and formatted output
- **Command Pattern**: Clean CLI commands that delegate to core services
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **Thin CLI Layer**: Minimal business logic in CLI, delegates to core services

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] Rich terminal UI system with styling, progress bars, and error formatting
- [ ] CLI commands implemented with command pattern and proper delegation
- [ ] Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions
- [ ] All emoji usage replaced with Rich terminal styling
- [ ] CLI layer is thin with minimal business logic
- [ ] Comprehensive error scenarios covered with appropriate user guidance
- [ ] All modules have 80%+ test coverage including CLI integration
- [ ] Type hints throughout with mypy compliance

## Slice Files

- [slice-12a-console-theme.md](./slice-12a-console-theme.md) - Console & Theme bootstrap with Rich Console and custom theming
- [slice-12b-progress-components.md](./slice-12b-progress-components.md) - Progress Components with spinner/progress-bar wrappers and progress manager
- [slice-12c-formatter-error-views.md](./slice-12c-formatter-error-views.md) - Formatter & Error Views with table/tree render utils and error panels
- [slice-13a-core-cli-scaffold.md](./slice-13a-core-cli-scaffold.md) - Core CLI Scaffold with Click/Typer parser and core commands
- [slice-13b-generate-suite.md](./slice-13b-generate-suite.md) - Generate Suite with gen/regen/add commands
- [slice-13c-diff-history-suite.md](./slice-13c-diff-history-suite.md) - Diff & History Suite with diff/log/show/commit commands
- [slice-12-rich-ui.md](./slice-12-rich-ui.md) - **[DEPRECATED]** Combined slice split into 12A/12B/12C
- [slice-13-cli-commands.md](./slice-13-cli-commands.md) - **[DEPRECATED]** Combined slice split into 13A/13B/13C

## Completion

Once this phase is complete, the refactoring is finished. The monolithic `__main__.py` will be replaced with a thin entry point (~50 lines) that delegates to the new modular architecture. All existing CLI functionality will be preserved while providing a much more maintainable and extensible codebase.
