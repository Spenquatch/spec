# PHASE-5: User Interface

## Overview

Creates the final user interface layer with Rich terminal UI and comprehensive CLI commands. This phase completes the refactoring by building a clean presentation layer that uses all the core services, while integrating enhanced error handling and user experience improvements.

## Prerequisites

- **PHASE-1 complete**: Exception hierarchy, logging, configuration, and Rich terminal styling
- **PHASE-2 complete**: File system operations
- **PHASE-3 complete**: Template system
- **PHASE-4 complete**: Git operations and core business logic services
- **Required modules**: All previous phase modules available

## Slice Execution Order

Execute slices in the following order due to dependencies:

1. **slice-12-rich-ui.md** - Must be first (provides UI components for CLI commands)
2. **slice-13-cli-commands.md** - Second (depends on Rich UI components for error handling and display)

## Shared Concepts

- **Rich Terminal UI**: Comprehensive styling, progress bars, and formatted output
- **Command Pattern**: Clean CLI commands that delegate to core services
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **Thin CLI Layer**: Minimal business logic in CLI, delegates to core services

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] Rich terminal UI system with styling, progress bars, and error formatting
- [ ] CLI commands implemented with command pattern and proper delegation
- [ ] Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions
- [ ] All emoji usage replaced with Rich terminal styling
- [ ] CLI layer is thin with minimal business logic
- [ ] Comprehensive error scenarios covered with appropriate user guidance
- [ ] All modules have 80%+ test coverage including CLI integration
- [ ] Type hints throughout with mypy compliance

## Slice Files

- [slice-12-rich-ui.md](./slice-12-rich-ui.md) - Rich terminal UI system with error handling integration
- [slice-13-cli-commands.md](./slice-13-cli-commands.md) - CLI commands with enhanced error messages

## Completion

Once this phase is complete, the refactoring is finished. The monolithic `__main__.py` will be replaced with a thin entry point (~50 lines) that delegates to the new modular architecture. All existing CLI functionality will be preserved while providing a much more maintainable and extensible codebase.
