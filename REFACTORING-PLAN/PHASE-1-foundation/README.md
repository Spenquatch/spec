# PHASE-1: Foundation Infrastructure

## Overview

Establishes the foundational infrastructure for the refactored architecture including custom exception hierarchy, comprehensive logging system, and centralized configuration management. This phase also integrates terminal styling with Rich to replace emoji usage throughout the codebase.

## Prerequisites

- None (this is the foundation phase)
- Current monolithic `__main__.py` exists and is functional

## Slice Execution Order

Execute slices in the following order due to dependencies:

1. **slice-1-exceptions.md** - Must be first (other slices depend on exception types)
2. **slice-2-logging.md** - Second (depends on exceptions for error handling)  
3. **slice-3-configuration.md** - Third (depends on exceptions and logging, integrates terminal styling)

## Shared Concepts

- **Exception Hierarchy**: All custom exceptions inherit from `SpecError` base class
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent logging format with contextual information
- **Settings Pattern**: Centralized configuration with environment variable support
- **Rich Integration**: Terminal styling system replaces all emoji usage

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] Custom exception hierarchy implemented with context support
- [ ] Debug logging system with timing and structured output
- [ ] Configuration management with environment variable support  
- [ ] Rich terminal styling integrated (no emoji characters remain)
- [ ] All foundation modules have 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Type hints throughout with mypy compliance

## Slice Files

- [slice-1-exceptions.md](./slice-1-exceptions.md) - Custom exception hierarchy
- [slice-2-logging.md](./slice-2-logging.md) - Debug logging and timing infrastructure
- [slice-3-configuration.md](./slice-3-configuration.md) - Settings management with terminal styling

## Next Phase

Once complete, enables PHASE-2 (filesystem operations) which will use the exception handling, logging, and configuration systems established here.
