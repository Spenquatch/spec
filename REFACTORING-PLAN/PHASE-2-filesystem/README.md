# PHASE-2: File System Operations

## Overview

Extracts and organizes all file system operations into clean, testable abstractions. This phase creates the foundation for path handling, file analysis, and directory management that will be used throughout the application.

## Prerequisites

- **PHASE-1 complete**: Exception hierarchy, logging, and configuration systems available
- **Required modules**: `spec_cli.exceptions`, `spec_cli.logging`, `spec_cli.config`

## Slice Execution Order

Execute slices in the following order due to dependencies:

1. **slice-4-path-resolution.md** - Must be first (other slices depend on path utilities)
2. **slice-5-file-analysis.md** - Second (independent, but used by directory management)
3. **slice-6-directory-management.md** - Third (depends on path resolution and file analysis)

## Shared Concepts

- **Path Resolution**: Consistent handling of relative/absolute paths and validation
- **File Type Detection**: Systematic categorization of files for processing decisions
- **Ignore Patterns**: Unified system for excluding files from operations
- **Error Handling**: All file operations use foundation exception hierarchy

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] Path resolution with validation and project boundary enforcement
- [ ] Comprehensive file type detection and analysis
- [ ] Directory management with ignore pattern support
- [ ] All file system operations use consistent error handling
- [ ] All modules have 80%+ test coverage including edge cases
- [ ] Type hints throughout with mypy compliance

## Slice Files

- [slice-4-path-resolution.md](./slice-4-path-resolution.md) - Path validation and resolution utilities
- [slice-5-file-analysis.md](./slice-5-file-analysis.md) - File type detection and metadata analysis
- [slice-6-directory-management.md](./slice-6-directory-management.md) - Directory operations and ignore patterns

## Next Phase

Once complete, enables PHASE-3 (template system) which will use the file system operations for template loading and content generation.
