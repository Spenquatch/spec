  Slice 1b Implementation Summary

  Goal Achieved: Successfully extracted workflow execution logic into a
  dedicated WorkflowExecutor class with 5/7 McCabe complexity (within the
  ≤7 limit).

  ✅ Files Created:

  - spec_cli/core/executors/__init__.py - Package initialization
  - spec_cli/core/executors/workflow_executor.py - New WorkflowExecutor
  class (147 lines)
  - tests/unit/core/executors/__init__.py - Test package initialization
  - tests/unit/core/executors/test_workflow_executor.py - Comprehensive
  tests (449 lines, 17 test cases)

  ✅ Files Modified:

  - spec_cli/core/workflow_orchestrator.py - Refactored to use
  WorkflowExecutor (removed 107 lines of duplicate logic)
  - tests/unit/core/test_workflow_orchestrator.py - Fixed tests to work
  with new architecture

  ✅ Functionality Implemented:

  The WorkflowExecutor handles the complete execution workflow with these
  capabilities:

  Inputs: {workflow: WorkflowState, file_path: Path, options: dict[str,
  Any]}

  Actions:
  - ✅ Execute generation stage using content_generator
  - ✅ Conditionally execute commit stage if auto_commit
  - ✅ Execute cleanup stage
  - ✅ Return execution result with generated files

  Outputs: {success: bool, generated_files: dict[str, Path], commit_info:
  dict | None}

  ✅ Quality Validation:

  - 100% test coverage for new WorkflowExecutor module
  - 17 comprehensive test cases covering all success/failure scenarios
  - McCabe complexity: 5/7 (within requirement ≤7)
  - Type safety: All functions fully typed with mypy --strict passing
  - Integration testing: Works with real WorkflowState objects
  - Error handling: Proper exception handling with structured error context

  ✅ Architecture Benefits:

  1. Separation of concerns: Orchestrator handles coordination, Executor
  handles execution
  2. Code reusability: Executor can be used by other workflow components
  3. Improved testability: Easier to test execution logic in isolation
  4. McCabe complexity reduction: Complex execution logic moved out of
  orchestrator
  5. Dependency injection: Clean dependency injection pattern implemented

  All tests pass (1603/1603), all quality gates pass, and the refactoring
  maintains backward compatibility while improving the architecture. The
  implementation follows all development standards and achieves the
  specified requirements.

  - create_backup(workflow_id) - Creates backup tags with validation
  - rollback_to_backup(backup_tag, commit_hash) - Performs rollback
  operations
  - Comprehensive input validation and error handling
  - Structured logging with error context
  - 100% test coverage with 25 unit tests

  Integration:
  - SpecWorkflowOrchestrator now uses WorkflowBackupManager for all backup
  operations
  - Simplified backup and rollback stages in workflow execution
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflow metadata

  Quality Validation:
  - All tests pass (1628 tests total)
  - 100% code coverage for new backup manager

  points, uses the create_error_context helper, and provides atomic backup
  operations with proper error handling. The backup manager is now a
  dedicated, reusable component that can be used by other workflow
  components in the future.

Slice 2a: Extract BatchProgressTracker - Complete

  I have successfully completed Slice 2a by extracting progress tracking
  logic from BatchFileProcessor into a dedicated BatchProgressTracker
  class. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

  ✅ Implemented Components

  failed, skipped files)
    - Emits progress events through existing ProgressReporter
  infrastructure
    - Provides summary statistics and progress calculations
    - McCabe complexity: 4/7 (within required limits)
  2. Refactored BatchFileProcessor
  (spec_cli/file_processing/batch_processor.py):
    - Now uses BatchProgressTracker for all progress tracking
    - Maintains backward compatibility with existing progress callbacks
    - Cleaner separation of concerns between processing and tracking
